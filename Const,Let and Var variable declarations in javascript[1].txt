const: const stands for "constant." When you declare a variable with 
const, its value cannot be changed once assigned. It provides a 
read-only reference to a value. Use const when you know the value 
won't change throughout your code.

const PI = 3.14;

let: let allows you to declare a variable with block scope. It means
 the variable's scope is limited to the block where it's defined 
(within curly braces {}). You can change the value of a let variable. 
Use let when you need a variable that can be reassigned within a block.

let counter = 0;
counter = 1; // Value can be changed

var: var is the older way of declaring variables in JavaScript. It has
 function scope, which means the variable is accessible within the
 entire function in which it is defined. Unlike let and const, var
 doesn't have block scope. It can be reassigned and hoisted (i.e., 
moved to the top of its scope).
var message = "Hello!";
