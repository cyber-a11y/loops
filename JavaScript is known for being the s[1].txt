JavaScript is known for being the scripting language used on web pages.
 When you visit a website and see interactive elements like buttons that 
change color when you click on them, or forms that validate your input, 
that's often done with JavaScript. However, JavaScript is not only used 
in web browsers. It can also be used in other environments like Node.js,
 Apache CouchDB, and Adobe Acrobat.

JavaScript is a prototype-based language, which means it has a different
 way of creating and using objects compared to some other languages.
 It supports multiple programming paradigms,which are different ways of 
thinking about and structuring code. It can be used in an object-oriented
 style, where you can create objects with properties and methods. It also
 supports imperative programming, which is a more step-by-step approach 
to writing code. Additionally, it supports declarative programming, 
which is a style that focuses on describing what you want to achieve 
without specifying the exact steps to get there. This includes functional
 programming, where you can use functions as first-class citizens in your
 code.

JavaScript is single-threaded, which means it can only do one thing at a
 time. It doesn't have built-in support for running multiple tasks 
simultaneously. However, there are techniques and libraries that allow
 for asynchronous programming, which helps with handling tasks that may
 take some time to complete.

Overall, JavaScript is a flexible and versatile programming language that
 can be used in different environments, not just for web development.
 It supports various programming styles and has features that allow you to
 create interactive and dynamic applications.
nb:paradigm is a way or style of doing something ie i different sets of
guide. its a different way thinking and structuring your code.
there types of programming approaches which are functional programming
object oriented.
The standards for JavaScript are the ECMAScript Language Specification (ECMA-262)
ECMAScript (often abbreviated as ES) is the official standard 
specification for the JavaScript programming language. JavaScript is an 
implementation of the ECMAScript standard.
ecmascript tells programmers hoe to write javascript correctly.
ECMAScript is like the official set of rules for the JavaScript
 programming language. It tells programmers how they should write and 
use JavaScript.

Just like you need to follow the rules in a game to play it correctly,
 programmers need to follow the rules in ECMAScript to write JavaScript
 code correctly.
