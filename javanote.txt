JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled
 programming language with first-class functions. While it is most well-
known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser 
environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe 
Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-
object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming)
 styles
variables are like containers that can hold different value.
javascript can write a program that tells a computer to make a decision.
you can make a computer to make maths.
you can use java to make effects on webpage better than css.
to make a computer stand your java code u need to write in the right place
with the right grammar and spelling.
JavaScript is a powerful programming language that can add interactivity 
to a website. It was invented by Brendan Eich.
JavaScript is versatile and beginner-friendly. With more experience, 
you'll be able to create games, animated 2D and 3D graphics, 
comprehensive database-driven apps, and much more!.
JavaScript itself is relatively compact, yet very flexible. Developers 
have written a variety of tools on top of the core JavaScript language, 
unlocking a vast amount of functionality with minimum effort.

Browser Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) built into web browsers,
 providing functionality such as dynamically creating HTML and setting CSS 
styles; collecting and manipulating a video stream from a user's webcam, or
 generating 3D graphics and audio samples.
Third-party APIs that allow developers to incorporate functionality in sites 
from other content providers, such as Twitter or Facebook.
Third-party frameworks and libraries that you can apply to HTML to accelerate 
the work of building sites and applications.
Browser APIs: These are tools that are built into web browsers. They give 
programmers special abilities to do things on a website. For example, they 
can use browser APIs to create new parts of a webpage, change how things 
look with different styles, or even use a person's webcam to capture videos. 
It's like having a special toolbox of functions that helps programmers add cool 
features to websites.
Third-party APIs: These are tools created by other companies or services that 
let programmers add extra features to their websites. For example, if a programmer
 wants to show a Twitter feed on their website, they can use the Twitter API, which
 provides functions that make it easy to get and display tweets. Similarly, there are
 APIs for Facebook, Google Maps, and many other services. It's like borrowing tools 
from other companies to make your website more powerful and interactive.
Frameworks and libraries: These are pre-made sets of code that programmers can use
 to speed up their work. Think of them as ready-made building blocks or templates. 
They provide a structure and ready-to-use functions that make it easier to create 
websites and applications. Instead of starting from scratch, programmers can use 
frameworks and libraries to save time and effort. It's like having a set of Lego
 blocks that you can quickly assemble to build something without having to create 
each piece.
So, in simple terms:

Browser APIs are built-in tools in web browsers that let programmers add special
 features to websites.
Third-party APIs are tools created by other companies that let programmers add 
extra features from those companies to their websites.
Frameworks and libraries are pre-made sets of code that help programmers build 
websites and applications faster.
